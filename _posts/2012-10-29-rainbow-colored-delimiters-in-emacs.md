While reading the clojure articles at kotka.de (for example [this
one](http://kotka.de/blog/2010/05/Did_you_know_IV.html)) I noticed the
nice syntax highlighting with rainbow colored parentheses.  So I
decided to see what Emacs package is available for that (not _if_ a
package is available, because it is fair to assume that if you can
think of a lisp-related editor feature, someone probably already
implemented it for Emacs).  I found
[rainbow-delimiters-mode](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/RainbowDelimiters)
and installed it via [ELPA](http://emacswiki.org/emacs/ELPA). As the
Emacs Wiki page mentions that the Zenburn and Solarized color themes
support rainbow delimiters, I installed them as well to try them
out. I decided to go with the Zenburn color theme for now. I am not
sure whether I won't prefer a less muted color scheme in the long run,
but it looks pretty nice and is supposedly easy on the eyes.
